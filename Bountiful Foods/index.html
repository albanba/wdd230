            <h2>Hermosa Beach</h2>
            <img src="/images/hermosabeach.webp" alt="Hermosa Beach" width="1600">
            <p>There’s a certain stylish vibe at Hermosa Beach and its 
            surrounding seaside community that you won’t find at other L.A. 
            beaches. You’re just as likely to see people shopping and relaxing 
            in outdoor cafes as you are the tanned and toned beach gods and goddesses 
            that frequent the sandy shoreline. Pier Plaza is the place to hang out when 
            you’d rather skip the sunscreen and beach towels. Once you’re on the shore, 
            a pristine expanse of sand awaits, with volleyball nets, plenty of space for 
            sunbathing and sandcastle building, and a paved walkway for strolling or biking.</p>

            <h2>Cabrillo Beach</h2>
            <img src="/images/cabrillobeach.webp" alt="Cabrillo Beach" width="1600">
            <p>Popular among travelers and locals hitting the beach with kids in tow, Cabrillo Beach is a 
            tranquil setting near San Pedro, with everything you need for the perfect family outing. 
            Located on a thin peninsula near Point Fermin Park, the beach actually has two sides — 
            one outside the breakwater that’s open to the surf, and one that’s open to the harbor. 
            Depending on the activity, you can select either side and enjoy some adventure or some 
            well-deserved relaxation. After you’re finished with the beach, head to the nearby Cabrillo 
            Marine Aquarium and enjoy the interactive exhibits, tidepool touch tanks and other unforgettable
            attractions.</p>

            <h2>Manhattan Beach</h2>
            <img src="/images/manhattanbeach.webp" alt="Manhattan Beach" width="1600">
            <p>At Manhattan Beach, it’s all beautiful people, shiny cars, 
                big sunglasses and little lap dogs. But that’s in the trendy 
                area of town next to the shore, where scenes from many television 
                shows have been filmed. On the sand, you’ll find beach volleyball 
                at courts that seem to go on for miles, and bodysurfing near the pier. 
                Check out the aquarium at the end of the pier, with its interesting sea 
                creatures and touch pool. When it comes to getting in the water, you should 
                know that surfing is limited to the south side of the pier and boogie boarding 
                is confined to the water north of the pier. Swimming is prohibited in the areas 
                immediately adjacent to the pier.</p>
